# Day Planner

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day. Users can enter the tasks they need to complete during the work day and save them to local storage. Each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 

## Design

The date is at the top of the page. 
Each time block is color coded as grey, red, or green. Grey blocks indiate the past, red blocks indicate the present, and green blocks indicate the future. 
The user can enter text into the time blocks and save them to local storage, which will save them even if the page is refreshed.
